## Getting Started

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app). To get started, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) and [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) installed on your machine.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/repository-name.git
   cd repository-name/app
   ```

2. Install the dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

#### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload when you make changes.

#### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

#### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes. Your app is ready to be deployed!

#### `npm run eject`

**Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back! This command will remove the single build dependency from your project and copy all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) right into your project for full control.
